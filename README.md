# Hybrid-Recommender-System-Project
Hybrid Recommender System

Business Problem
It is desired to develop a hybrid recommendation system by using the user-based and item-based recommender method through 
the data set containing the movies and the rating scores given to the movies.

Dataset Story
The dataset contains 2,000,0263 ratings across 27,278 movies. 
Includes 138,493 users and data from 09 January 1995 to 31 March 2015. 
Users are randomly selected. It is known that all selected users voted for at least 20 movies.

Evaluation
The framework of the project is to develop an item-based and user-based recommendation system.
In this direction, the first goal - within the scope of the user-based recommender system - 
is to recommend a movie based on the correlation between the taste habits of a selected user and the taste habits of other users. 
The second output to be achieved is to recommend a movie based on the correlation between the likes of a selected movie and the likes of other movies,
within the scope of the item-based recommender system. 

Finally, the outputs of both methods were compared under the name of Hybrid Recommender System and turned into output.
